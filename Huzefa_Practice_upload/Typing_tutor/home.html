        <h5>Why you should learn to touch-type?</h5>
        <p>
            Most people today use computers not only at work but also at home. It is desirable that the typist does not think about his finger placement or the location of the letters as he types. As everyone has to learn to type at some point, so why not learn this basic computing skill properly today? Knowing the right touch-type technique is useful for everyone. It will make you a more efficient worker as you will be able to type faster and more correctly. Knowing the right touch-type technique and posture will also help to avoid discomfort. Ergonomics is a very important part of keyboarding. Good ergonomic practice helps to avoid physical discomfort that may accompany prolonged static postures and repetitive motions. Work-related injuries such as tension in the neck and shoulder area, which are common problems for people working in front of a computer, can be avoided by following some simple ergonomic guidelines.
        </p>
        <h5>How to practice keyboarding with all fingers?</h5>
        <p>
            Keyboarding is learned finger by finger. Each finger has its own set of keys. Most keyboarding programs are designed so that they first introduce a new key. This key is first practiced on its own and in small words containing the letters that have been taught so far. Then the exercises move on to longer words, sentences, and text drills. Repetition and continuous practice make you a master. Little by little you become faster and more accurate typist.
        </p>
        <h5>What course is best for learning to type faster?</h5>
        <p>
            Typing Master 11 is a powerful typing tutor that will help you improve your typing substantially whether you are a novice or a professional typist. TypingMaster has nine different courses that will satisfy your changing needs as your skills and speed improve. The complete touch typing course will teach you the touch typing technique starting with the basics and advancing step-by-step using examples, word drills, and games to get you familiar with your keyboard. The Speed Building course helps you hone your typewriting skills once you have the basics covered. This is also good for experienced typists looking to keep their skill level up. Also, additional courses to practice the numbers, special character keys, and the numeric keypad are included.

        <h5>What productivity tool will make your life much easier?</h5>
        <p>Do you find yourself writing the same information repeatedly? Would you like to write the recurring text phrases faster? Autotext expander tool might be your newest best friend! Our professional QuickPhrase auto text tool helps in writing of frequently used text blocks faster! Feel free to download this clipboard utility that allows you to save text snippets and insert them quickly wherever your cursor is. You can customize the keyboard shortcuts or short abbreviations to expand text magically as you type!
        </p>
        <h5>How long does it take to learn to touch type?</h5>
        <p>
            You can choose how many lessons, exercises, and writing tests you will do. It takes between 6 to 10 hours to complete the entire basics course. If you prefer a shorter course, complete only the first two units of Lessons 1 – 10. The first two units of Lessons 1 – 10 will teach you the location of the alphabet keys on the keyboard. You can choose to complete each lesson unit or you can complete just a portion of any lesson unit and move on to another lesson.
        </p>
        <h5>How long should I practice typing daily?</h5>
        <p>
            As touch-typing is a cumulative motor skill, it would be ideal to practice daily or at least every second day. Developing good keyboarding skills throughout the course is also essential. Therefore, proper touch-typing should be reinforced whenever possible, preferably for at least 15 minutes every day. Of course, this is not always possible.
            <span>
                Variation in motor skill acquisition is great between individuals so it is difficult to set a definite minimum or maximum limits to a keyboarding session, but, in general, short periods of practice will yield better results than very long sessions. For best results, daily practicing periods should vary from 15 minutes to about one hour in length.
            </span>

        </div>
        <h5>How do you have good ergonomics?</h5>
        <p>
            To reduce stress in shoulder area, keyboard and mouse should be placed next to one another so that reaching is not necessary. Chair height and/or work surfaces must be adjusted so that the wrists and forearms remain in a straight line. Usually the best working posture for your arms is achieved when the input devices are at about elbow height. 
            <span>
                When working for long periods of time staring at a computer display it is important that the neck constantly remains in a relaxed position. Therefore the monitor must be placed and tilted so that it is directly in front of the user at or below eye level. This ensures that the head is not turned to left or right or awkwardly tilted upwards, which causes a lot of strain to neck and shoulder area. Placing the documents adjacent to the monitor or directly below it also helps to avoid neck pain when the students do not have to constantly twist and turn their necks. The monitor must be kept clean.
            </span>
        </p>
        <h5>How to have a good body posture?</h5>
        <p>There are a few useful guidelines that should always be kept in mind when working on a computer. It may be a good idea to print out these guidelines and keep them near workstation so that they can be easily referred to whenever necessary.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Do not lift your shoulders, this causes tension.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rest your elbows close to your body. Use armrests whenever possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not bend or twist your neck.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep your forearms and wrists in a straight line.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep your fingers slightly curved.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep your feet flat on the floor or on a footstool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a light touch when you write on computer.
            </li>
            Remember that no position or posture is correct for long periods of time. Remember to change positions frequently, take small breaks and stretch or even walk around a bit. Regular movement will prevent discomfort and fatigue effectively.
